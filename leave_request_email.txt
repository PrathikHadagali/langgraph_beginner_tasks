Dear Himangshu Sir,

I hope this message finds you in good health and spirits.

I am writing to request a leave on Diwali for three days, as I only have one casual leave available for this month. However, I would like to use two of my previous month's leaves, which I have not taken yet.

Please let me know if this is possible.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
